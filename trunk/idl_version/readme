1. in the config file, change the input directory and output directory. Please do not add any space when you do the changes. Just replace the directory part.

2. Specify a radius in the config file. This is the searching aperture, in unit of Mpc. I put 1.0 Mpc for example.

3. In command line, type: idl rungmbcg

4. It is done!
