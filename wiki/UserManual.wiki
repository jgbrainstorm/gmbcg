0. The input catalog should be in fit file format. Exactly specified as here:

    * ID: A unique id # for that galaxy
    * OMAG: The observed DES magnitudes after a simple model for photometric errors has been included.
    * OMAGERR: Estimated photometric errors for each band.
    * RA: Galaxy position.
    * DEC: Galaxy position.
    * PHOTOZ: Estimated photo-z based using a gaussian PDF with Ïƒ = 0.03/(1+z).


#---------the following is the directions about how to run it--------------

1. in the config file, change the input directory and output directory. Please do not add any space when you do the changes. Just replace the directory part.

2. Specify a radius in the config file. This is the searching aperture, in unit of Mpc. I put 1.0 Mpc for example.

3. In command line, type: idl rungmbcg

4. It is done!
